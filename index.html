					<h2>My Life with Sally</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
					My name is Graeme, I’m one of the software engineers currently working under Digital Insurance Sales portfolio. <br/><br/>

					You can normally find me by spotting the grumpiest person on the floor, but today is an exception with the generous supply of drinks thanks to organisers who set this up, and of course, thank you all who attended to make this happen. <br/><br/>

					I've had a few people asked me who Sally is prior to this talk but I can reassure you that she is not my ex girlfriend, and definitely not my mistress, so for those who know my wife, please don't go texting my wife telling her what I'm up to at work.

					<i>noun</i> <br/>
					noun: <b>routine</b>; plural noun: <b>routines</b><br/><br/>

					1. a sequence of actions regularly followed.<br/>

					<aside class="notes">
					Majority of us live in a busy lifestyle where we tend to stick to our routines. Generally we will also try to re-prioritise our routine each day so that we can be more efficient.<br/><br/>

					In that I'll share with you an example of what my routine is like as a husband and a father of two boys: <br/>
					- My morning is usually occupied ensuring that my eldest son are well fed in the morning, all dressed up ready for school and not to mention ensuring that my eldest son'slunchbox and crunch and sip are ready to start the day. Once I palm off the responsibility to the school, that’s when I can leave for work.<br/><br/>
					- After work, I will fetch the kids home and ensure that dinner is ready on time for the family, so I can get the kids all sorted ready for bed. Once the kids are asleep this is when I get to do whatever I want - literally.<br/><br/>
					- This is generally my daily routine in brief with a slight difference on weekends with more chores to do - but you get the idea without me blabbering too much.<br/><br/>
					- Unfortunately, my routine is non negotiable as I report to three bosses at home. This is the story of my life.

					<aside class="notes">
					So imagine this:<br/><br/>
					- I know how to dress my kids for the day, and whether or not if we need to pack up additional raincoat or slap on extra layer of sunscreen <br/><br/>
					- Or perhaps, my weekend is all planned out with ideas of places to bring my kids to <br/><br/>
					- Or maybe, I can ensure that my kids do not get bored with my cooking, with cooking different meals each day <br/><br/>
					- Even better, grocery is done and delivered to my door steps without having me to be at the supermarket <br/><br/>
					- Last but not least, I do not have to answer hard questions to my eldest son like where do babies come from <br/><br/>
					- And all these can be achieved through a two way conversation experience without physical interaction with a device to help me with  my daily routine. Better still. I'm doing more with less so to make my day more efficient and convenient <br/><br/>

					<aside class="notes">
					This is where I found Sally, a side project which I built in the attempt to address some of what I have mentioned.<br/><br/>
					

					She is a voice virtual assistant, built in Python and is currently hooked up to: <br/>
					- Google Speech API for transcribing speech to text<br/>
					- eSpeak for speech synthesis enablement<br/>
					- Hotword or wakeword integration which provides a more personalised experience<br/>
					- Last but not least, integrated with purposeful APIs - and at this point it’s only with a weather API<br/><br/>

					There is definitely a lot more to enhance with Sally, but I’m hoping that once I release the first version of Sally publicly, I get to encourage contributors who are keen learners to contribute this project as a learning experience<br/><br/>
					If you are wondering if this is built to replace Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or the likes - the answer is no. This is merely a side project for myself to learn and explore the capability of voice user interface<br/><br/>

					I'm sharing this with you not to tell you how not so exciting my daily routine is, but sharing this a simple use case where you could also tap into the capability of voice user interface that works for you or the people around you. It does not have to be complex or huge and you do not have to be an expert in this field. Most importantly. Start small, have fun, and explore.<br/><br/>
				
					However, I will leave you a piece of advice. If you are planning to have a personalised experience creating your own wakeword or hotword and name after a person, please make sure you consider picking the least attractive name so to keep your partner happy.<br/><br/>


					If you would like to know more about Sally, please reach out to me after this.<br/><br/>
